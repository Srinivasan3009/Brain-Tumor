# Brain Tumor Classification – Naan Mudhalvan Project

This project is developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan** skill development program under the subject **Deep Learning**. It aims to classify brain tumors from MRI scans using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and provides predictions via an interactive **Gradio** interface.

## 📌 Introduction

Brain tumor classification is a crucial step in medical imaging and diagnosis. This project utilizes deep learning to categorize brain MRI images into one of the following four classes:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

The trained model is deployed with a Gradio UI, allowing users to upload MRI images and get instant predictions.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**:  

2. Upload your MRI image dataset or connect to your Google Drive.

3. Run all cells in `project2.ipynb` to:
   - Train the CNN model
   - Launch the Gradio interface

4. Use the Gradio web app to upload MRI images and view tumor classification results.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Improve prediction accuracy using deeper CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Train with a larger and more diverse dataset for better generalization
- Deploy the Gradio app online for broader accessibility
